## Card Statement 3.0

The objective is to re-imagine the customer experience for the monthly credit or debit card statement.

The first generation of card statements featured "country club style billing". Each monthly statement included all of the transactions for that month, and served as a reminder to the customer of their activity at the club. You received a thick package of little paper slips / receipts that documented all of the relevant transactions, together with a summary statement showing the total amount due that month.

The second generation of card statements, introduced as transaction systems became electronic, did away with the paper slips and instead included only the summary statement of all transactions for the month.

Over time, the amount of bumf included in the monthly statement has increased. Privacy notices, marketing mailers, other inclusions that are not valued by the customer and probably go straight into the trash.

The goal here is to re-invent the monthly statement to make it something engaging, informative and useful. Whether on paper or online, how can the card statement be:
* personalized?
* informative?
* engaging?

The solution is to convert a dry list of transactions with hard-to-decipher merchant names into a narrative of the customer's payments behavior in the past month. Rather than a table, a visualization will summarize monthly expenses. For example, a map view or a category view (groceries vs. restaurants vs. clothes, etc.). 

Second, with customer permission, we can pull in contextual data like relevant Google Photos (with a similar timestamp / geotag) to help remind the customer of the things they experienced and paid for in the past month (e.g., a mash-up of customer-generated photos at a live concert combined with the ticket purchase, dinner and drinks paid for night of the concert).

Third, contextual information / advice will be included. For example, month-on-month trends or outliers. E.g., your Comcast bill is usually $90, but this month it's $120, just wanted to make sure that looks right to you. Or, you spend $200 on Starbucks this month, usually you only spend $80. Go easy on the coffee! This is Mint-lite functionality.
