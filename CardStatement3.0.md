Card Statement 3.0

The objective is to re-imagine the customer experience for the monthly credit or debit card statement.

The first generation of card statements featured "country club style billing". Each monthly statement included all of the transactions for that month, and served as a reminder to the customer of their activity at the club. You received a thick package of little paper slips / receipts that documented all of the relevant transactions, together with a summary statement showing the total amount due that month.

The second generation of card statements, introduced as transaction systems became electronic, did away with the paper slips and instead included only the summary statement of all transactions for the month.

Over time, the amount of bumf included in the monthly statement has increased. Privacy notices, marketing mailers, other inclusions that are not valued by the customer and probably go straight into the trash.

The goal here is to re-invent the monthly statement to make it something engaging, informative and useful. Whether on paper or online, how can the card statement be:
* personalized?
* informative?
* engaging?
