#Collaborators flow for Blocbox

The collaborators page will have a "+" sign to allow new collaborators to be added. It will also list existing collaborators that can be edited or deleted. With a view to mobile-first design, we will allow new collaborators to be invited via email, phone number or social media handles (FB id, Twitter handle). We may also want to use gestures/swipes e.g., swipe left to delete, swipe right to edit collaborator.

We won't require a sign-up for the collaborator. While this reduces security, the gains in openness and reduced friction will encourage more frequent collaboration.

#Adding and edits tags for Blocbox

Users will be able to add tags to any piece of content (link, image, note). The idea is to help organize content into various categories, although tags are an optional additional input on a piece of content. Any existing content can have tags added or edited by the user. Ideally, the tags auto-complete based on historical tags used and auto-suggest based on most frequently used tags (e.g., typing "p" pulls up "photos", typing "l" pulls up logos, etc.)
