#Collaborators flow for Blocbox

The collaborators page will have a "+" sign to allow new collaborators to be added. With a view to mobile-first design, we will allow new collaborators to be invited via email, phone number or social media handles (FB id, Twitter handle).

We won't require a sign-up for the collaborator. While this reduces security, the gains in openness and reduced friction will encourage more frequent collaboration.
