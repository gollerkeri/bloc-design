# Blocbox Competitive Analysis
9/9/15

Based on Blocbox survey results, competitors include: email, browser, Evernote and Pocket. For this analysis, I want to pick email, browser and Pocket as the competitors on whom to conduct a SWOT analysis.

###Email
####Strengths:
* Ubiquitous, multi-device access
* Easy to access. User typically already logged into their email service
####Weaknesses:
* Easy to lose content. Users indicated saving links and other useful information in draft form and sometimes losing draft emails
* Hard to search / recover older data since it can get lost in the overall email workflow

###Browser
####Strengths:
* Most frequently cited tool for saving links and content
* Ease of use, frictionless
####Weaknesses:
* Not searchable
* Not accessible across devices
* Not suitable for some tasks like To Do Lists, note taking
