# Blocbox Competitive Analysis
# 9/9/15

Based on Blocbox survey results, competitors include: email, browser, Evernote and Pocket. For this analysis, I want to pick email, browser and Pocket as the competitors on whom to conduct a SWOT analysis.

Email
Strengths:
* Ubiquitous, multi-device access
* Easy to access. User typically already logged into their email service
Weaknesses:
* Easy to lose content. Users indicated saving links and other useful information in draft form and sometimes losing draft emails
* Hard to search / recover older data since it can get lost in the overall email workflow
